## 3 Player data analysis
### 3.1 Top 10 players by efficiency 
![top 10 player by Efficiency](chart/top10playerByEfficiency.svg)
Generated by showTop10PlayersByEfficiency.py

The graph is created based on the efficiency of the players. Efficiency is one of the most important critera to 
test a player's value, and it is culculated by a formula, which contains many different data from multiple aspects, 
so I chose this index to create the graph. Base on the graph, there are several conclusions we can get.\
First, most directly, we can see the ranking of the players based on efficiency and who were the top ten. \
Second, although the top one player has the highest efficiency, not all of her data is the top one of the game. For example, 
the total points her got was not the highest. This further reflects that efficiency is a comprehensive index.


### 3.2 Player Compare 
Top 5 China Player Compare
This radar graph presents the datas of five players, Xu Han, Yueru Li, Sijing Huang, Liwei Yang, and Siyu Wang, from China.
The data includes points, steals, turnovers, rebounds, freethrows,and assists because these are the most essential 
criterion to judge whether the player is efficient on the court.

When I first created the graph by showing all the real and original data, the graph is inconvenient to observe 
because the range for different data is different. To solve this problem, I used sklearn.preprocessing imported from
MinMaxScaler to standardize all the data so that the range of the data would all be one, which is more convenient for us
to make conclusions.

By looking at this graph, we can find out who has the advantage in all of these areas: \
Xu Han got the most points, rebounds, and freethrows. However, she got the least assists, steals, and turnovers, which are
the areas that Han should improve on.\
Sijing Huang got the most steals and least steals and points within these five players. Huang should improve the strategies 
about how to get more points in a game.\
Yueru Li got the most turnovers and her ranking of rebounds is second, which is also her advantage. Yet, her steals,
assists, and freethrows are all medium in team China.\
Siyu Wang got the most assists and ranked second in turnovers. Nevertheless, Wang's steals, rebounds, and freethrows
are at medium in team China, and she can improve on these aspects.\
Liwei Yang's advantage is in assistance. She is ranking number two in assists. Yang can create opportunities for her
teammates to get points, which is also the basis of winning a game. As the captain of team China, Yang doesn't necessarily
need to be the top of the team, instead, she provides mental support for the team.

In conclusion, since the points and rebounds are the most important part of a game, Xu Han is definitely the most 
valuable and excellent player from China.


Xu Han is the greatest and the most vauable player in team China during the 2022 World Cup. The greatest player of the
whole 2022 World Cup is A'Ja Wilson from team USA. By comparing these two players, we can see what is the difference
between China and the world, and how or what to improve.

Generated by comparePlayerBenchmark.py

We can see that the graph is also standardized so that the ranges of data would be one.
According to the graph, Wilson has an advantage than Han in points, steals, and freethrows, especially in steals and 
freethrows because Wilson's data exceeds Han by a lot. Han's assists, turnovers, and rebounds are better than Wilson.
If Han wants to catch up the top player of the world, she should improve on her steals, freethrows, and try to get more 
points.
